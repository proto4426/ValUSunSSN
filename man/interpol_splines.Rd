\usage{
interpol_splines(y, nembed = 1, nsmo = 0, ncomp = 0, threshold1 = 1e-05,
  niter = 30, displ = F)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{a numeric data.frame or matrix of data with gaps}

\item{nembed}{integer value controlling
embedding dimension (must be > 1 for monovariate data)}

\item{nsmo}{integer value controlling cutoff time  scale
in number of samples. Set it to 0 if only one single time scale is desired.}

\item{ncomp}{controls the number of significant components.
It has to be specified for running in automatic mode.
Default (0) leads to manual selection during the algorithm}

\item{threshold1}{numeric value controllingthe stop of the iterations after
the relative energy change is < threshold}

\item{niter}{numeric value controlling the  maximum number of iterations}

\item{displ}{boolean controlling the display of some information in
the console during the algorithm}
}
\value{
A list with the following elements:
\describe{
  \item{\code{y.filled}}{The same dataset as y but with gaps filled}
  \item{\code{w.distSVD}}{The distribution of the weights of the SVD}
  \item{\code{errorByComp}}{Numeric vector of length \code{niter} (??)
  containing the errors associated to each iterations( or comp?)}
}
But only the first one really affects the outcome. A separation into
two scales only (with a threshold between 50–100 days) isenough to properly
capture both short- and long-term evolutions, and embedding dimensions of
D = 2−5 are usually adequate for reconstructing daily averages. The
determination of the optimum parameters and validation of the results is
preferably made by cross-validation.

\description{
This main function fills gaps in monovariate or multivariate data
by SVD-imputation which is closely related to
expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm with splines interpolation
}
\details{
The method decomposes the data into two time scales, which are processed
separately and then merged at the end. The cutoff time scale (nsmo) is
expressed in number of samples. A splines "filter" is used for filtering.
Monovariate data must be embedded first (nembed>1).
In the initial data set, gaps are supposed to be filled in with NA !!.

The three tuneable (hyper)parameters are :
\describe{
\item{ - \code{ncomp }}
\item{ - \code{nsmo}}
\item{ - \code{nembed}}
}
}
\examples{

# Take this for input, as advised in the test.m file
y <- sqrt(data.mat2.fin+1) # Selected randomly here, for testing

options(mc.cores=parallel::detectCores()) # all available cores
z_splines <- interpol_splines(y, nembed = 2, nsmo = 8, ncomp = 4,
                             niter = 30, displ = F)
# 80 sec for the whole dataset
z_splines <- z_splines$y.filled
z_splines = z_splines*z_splines - 1
z_splines[z_splines<0] <- 0
ssn_splines <- z_splines
